# Hand Gesture Stacking AI

This project lets you control and stack objects on screen using your hands.  
It uses your webcam with **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to track gestures.  
You can grab, move, and drop shapes, resize the sphere, and take photos with a thumbs-up gesture.  
Voice feedback tells you what actions are happening.

## Installation
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyttsx3
